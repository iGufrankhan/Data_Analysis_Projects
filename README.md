                                                          Data Analysis Projects: Black Sales, Heart Disease,Sugarcane and GDP
                             This repository contains four distinct data analysis projects carried out using Jupyter Notebooks. These projects focus on exploring, visualizing, 
                             and building predictive models using different datasets

1.Black Sales Analysis
Description: This project explores the sales data from a retail or e-commerce platform (e.g., Black Friday sales).
The goal is to analyze patterns in customer behavior, sales performance, and provide actionable insights that can help businesses optimize their strategies during peak sales periods.
2.Heart Disease Prediction
Description: This project uses the Heart Disease dataset to predict the likelihood of a person developing heart disease based on various features like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical indicators. 
The project aims to build a machine learning model to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart disease.
3.GDP Analysis
Description: This project focuses on analyzing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for different countries or regions.
The goal is to observe trends, compare economic growth between countries, and perform forecasting for future GDP values.
4.Sugar Yield
Description: The project aims to analyze factors affecting sugarcane yield in order to improve farming techniques and optimize the growth of sugarcane crops.
This includes investigating correlations between various environmental, agricultural, and climatic factors, as well as building predictive models to estimate crop yields.
